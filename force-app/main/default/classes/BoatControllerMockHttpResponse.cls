Offering simplicity and ease of maintenance, she\\u2019s a ready-to-go fishing machine equipped for inshore and offshore missions as well as a versatile cruising boat with reliable inboard diesel power.<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p> <p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><strong>The 140-square-foot Cockpit has room for the entire crew or family. The Cockpit sole is built with a laminated in-deck mounting plate for fighting chair, rocket launcher or table installations. Standard equipment and features include a Cockpit bait freezer with upper tray, in-deck insulated fish boxes port and starboard with overboard drainage, a walk-through transom door and lift gate, a transom fish box and live well, rod holders, tackle storage and fresh and sea-water wash downs. Two-person, mezzanine-style seats flank the centerline walkthrough, and there\\u2019s refrigerated drink storage in the starboard mezzanine step, as well as ample general stowage throughout.<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p> <p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><strong>The 46 Billfish\\u2019s Command Deck can be completely enclosed and is climate-controlled. It\\u2019s perfect for anglers who want to get off their feet and cool down as the boat moves from one spot to the next.\\u00a0 The Command Deck features a Salon-like living area with a roomy U-shaped lounge and Hi-Lo table and a lounge that extends along the starboard side. Both seating areas hold rod storage underneath.<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p> <p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><strong>The 46 Billfish\\u2019s Flybridge is designed with a tournament-style Center Console walk-around Helm. The 46 Billfish has Palm Beach-style controls and power-assist hydraulic steering. Seating includes a single Release Marine teak chair (a second helm chair is optional) and lounges to port and starboard and a forward console seat.<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p> <p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><strong>Rest up and recharge in the 46 Billfish\\u2019s air-conditioned Cabin. Featuring high-gloss teak cabinetry and custom Amtico flooring, the fully appointed starboard-side Galley has an L-shaped Corian countertop, a two-burner electric stove, a microwave\\/convection oven, cabinet storage and under-counter drawer-style refrigeration with a built-in ice maker. The private Head, which is conveniently located immediately to port of the Companionway stairs, has a large walk-in shower with satin nickel fixtures, an attractive Corian-topped vanity with sink and storage and a medicine cabinet with mirrored doors. Easily accessible upper and lower bunks on the port side await weary anglers, and there\\u2019s a hanging locker only a few steps away. The first-class accommodations continue in the private Forward Stateroom, with its island queen bed, a hanging locker, upper storage cabinetry and a flat-screen TV with stereo, speakers and DVD player.<\\/strong><\\/em><br \\/><br \\/><em><strong>A modified vinylester resin is used in the entire Hull skin. End-grain balsa and closed-cell foam are used as coring materials in selected areas for optimized strength and stiffness while minimizing weight. The integral fiberglass fuel tank, sealed to the Hull with resin foam, is resin infused with balsa coring on all sides for stiffness. The Hull-to-Deck joint is mechanically fastened every three inches and fiberglassed inside.<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p> <p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><strong>The Billfish is designed and built with many of the same mechanical systems, components and technologies found on larger Vikings.
